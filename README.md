# CEDS Collaborative Exchange
Welcome to the CEDS Open Source Community!  

The Common Education Data Standards (CEDS) Collaborative Exchange is a repository of code developed by the CEDS team. The CEDS Collaborative Exchange repository interacts with the CEDS Integrated Data Store and the CEDS Elements. All resources in the open source community are considered free and open source.

## Getting Started
Each contributor should provide a README file which introduces and explains the code and how to implement it.  At a minimum, the Contributor will provide information about installation, testing, deployment, and their contact information.  Refer to the README_TEMPLATE.md file at the root of this repository. 

## Contributing
Please read [Contributing.md](https://github.com/CEDStandards/CEDS-Collaborative-Exchange/blob/master/Contributing.md) for details on the process for submitting use cases and pull requests.

## Versioning
The CEDS Collaborative Exchange will not maintain versioning for the whole repository. It is recommended that users who contribute resources to this repository provide a README file and include versioning in that file. For consistency and to assist stakeholders in the use of the resource, staying consistent with the versioning guidelines expressed in the other OSC repositories is highly encouraged. Two different version numbers should be supplied in the README file:
1.	The version for the resource in the repository.
2.	The version of the CEDS IDS and/or DW this resource is compatible with. This will allow stakeholders to see which resources should work with the version of CEDS they are on currently and which may be outdated and require additional work to bring them to the current version of CEDS.

## License
All contributions to this repository are considered licensed under the [Apache License 2.0] (https://github.com/CEDStandards/CEDS-Collaborative-Exchange/blob/master/LICENSE).
